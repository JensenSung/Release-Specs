RIOT Release Specs
------------------

## What does this specification contain?

This repository contains a couple of text files describing the goals that have
to be fulfilled before the current release (2015.12) can be tagged.
If all goals are fulfilled for a certain commit of a branch in the
https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT git repository, this commit may be tagged as
2015.012.

This repository also contains a bunch of tests corresponding to the release
specification. For verifying that the targeted commit is ready for a release,
please clone and checkout a fresh copy of the targeted RIOT branch and then
execute all the tests in this repository sequentially.
